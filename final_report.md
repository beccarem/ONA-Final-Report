## Introduction

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is the agency within the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce that issues patents and trademarks. It is one
in few organizations around the world to guarantee the intellectual
property rights or inventors. Although the organization plays an
important role in the capitalist society, it is now faced with many
challenges and criticisms that it needs to address.

One of the challenges is the time it takes examiners to process an
application. As the agency is fully funded by patent applications fees,
the focus should be to ensure a satisfactory “customer experience.”
However, when examiners take a long time to process applications, this
can be a frustrating experience for applicants. USPTO is now taking
action to improve its entire process by identifying the causes of
application backlogs.

Our goal is to understand what causes delays in processing times, which
characteristics makes examiners more efficient in their work and how can
network analysis solve the organizational difficulties that USPTO is
facing. We will focus on determining the organizational and social
factors associated with the length of patent application prosecution. We
will look at how examiner’s demographics (gender, race, tenure) are
related to their application processing time. We will also look at the
social advice network within the organization plays a role in improving
the patent application times and outcomes.
